Missing abilities:

Lethal for Reaper
Sixthesense for Marksman


Gear Tactics class balance ideas:

Scout Magnum seems too weak - Maybe replace with Hit anid Run or perk that boosts flank hit chance and damage? But hunters instinct already exists further up in the tree. Or maybe put double shot 3 with increased distance and/or reduced cooldown or some other buff

Avenger on Vanguard should be more powerful than just a damage buff, maybe grant an action (or chance of an action) each time an ally is shot at/hit?
